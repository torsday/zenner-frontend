# Zenner (frontend)

Zenner, a.k.a [StareContest 2.0](https://github.com/RSS2013/StareContest2.0) is the product of Neurogaming Hackathon 2015, San Fran. Two people would use [Muse](http://www.choosemuse.com/) in competition of concentration and calmness. This is the HTML5 frontend displaying that match.

Although fully functional at the hackathon, I've toggled sample data on as the original project required hardware unlikely to be easily accessible to viewers of this repo.
